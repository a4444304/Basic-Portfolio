# Basic-Portfolio

The creation of my Basic-Portfolio, build my foundation of HTML  
CSS and (Git) version control.

## Description
Version control was used in this project to manage changes in 
my files. HTML was used to link documents together, such as
the link between my HTML and CSS on the portfolio page.
